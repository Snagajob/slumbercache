slumbercache
============

Slumber is a Python library that provides a convenient yet powerful
object-oriented interface to ReSTful APIs. It acts as a wrapper around the
excellent [requests library](http://python-requests.org/) and abstracts away the handling of URLs, serialization,
and request processing.
